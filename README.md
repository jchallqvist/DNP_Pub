## Description
This script contains the code used for the statistical analysis of data and the creation of figures for the paper "Proteomics and machine learning identify a distinct blood biomarker panel to detect Parkinsonâ€™s disease up to 7 years before motor disease".

The code was written in Python (version 3.8.5) using the packages SciPy (version 1.9.3), statsmodels (version 0.14.0), SciKit Learn (version 1.1.2) Seaborn (version 0.12.2) and Matplotlib (version 3.6.0). Linear mixed models were constructed using the R-to-Python bridge software pymer4 (version 0.8.0). 

The authors declare that all data supporting the findings of this study are available within the paper and its Supplementary information files or available from the corresponding author upon request. The raw targeted chromatograms are available via the Panorama repository https://panoramaweb.org/DNP_Pub.url.
